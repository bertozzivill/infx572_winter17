## 1. Arrays -----------------------------

## Make a vector called "good_music" three elements long. Each element should be the name of a band/musician you like.

## *update* good_music by appending two more musicians you like. 

## Use [] and : to display the 2nd through 4th elements of good_music.

## Make a new vector called "music_amelia_likes" with the elements "Alt-j", "Sia", "el ten eleven", and "Sylvan Esso".

## Use "which" to display the index of "Sia" in music_amelia_likes.

## Make a new vector called "combined_music" that combines good_music and music_amelia_likes.

## Use "which" and "-" to remove the element "el ten eleven" from combined_music. 
## Be sure to *update* combined_music, don't just display the altered vector. 


## 2. Loops -----------------------------

## Use a "for" loop to sequentially print out each element of combined_music.

## Make a vector called "music_rating" the same length as combined_music. 
## Each element of music_rating should be a score, from 1 to 5, of how much you like that musician. 
## Just make a number up if you don't recognize the artist. 

## Use a "for" loop to sequentially print out each element of combined_music, and its rating (according to the vector music_rating).


## 3. Logic -----------------------------

## write an "if" statement that prints "I don't like this musician" if the first artist in combined_music has a rating below 3.

## add an "else if" statement that prints "I'm ok with this musician" if the first artist in combined_music has a rating of 3 or 4.

## add an "else" statement that prints "I love this musician" if the first artist in combined_music has a rating of exactly 5.


## 4. Logic and Loops combined -----------------------------

## Modify the last "for" loop you wrote in section 1  such that, for each musician in combined_music,
## if the musician has a rating below 3, the console prints out "I don't like this musician".

## Modify this combined loop with an "else if" statement such that, if the musician has a rating of 3 or 4, 
## the console prints out "I'm ok with this musician".

## Modify *that* loop such that, if the musician has a rating of 5, the console prints out
# "I love this musician".
