## 1. libraries and data -----------------------------

## Load the ggplot2, data.table and car libraries. 

## load the dataset called "Wong" from the car library, and convert it to a data.table called "comas".

## 2. Plots -----------------------------

## Make a scatter plot of age vs coma duration, colored by sex.

## Make a scatter plot of coma duration vs piq, colored by age.

## Make a scatter plot of coma duration vs viq, faceted by sex and colored by piq.
## Label it appropriately. 

# ---

## Make a histogram (bar chart with counts) of the datset on the y-axis and sex on the x-axis.

## Change this histogram so the y-axis is mean piq. 


## Make a new dataset containing only individuals with more than three observations. 
##  Make a line plot of this dataset showing "days" vs piq, colored by id. Superimpose
##  The data points (aka a scatter plot) over this line plot.
