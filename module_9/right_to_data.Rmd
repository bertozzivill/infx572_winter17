Make whole thing into a video:

--23 and me: what it is, why they were shut down
--real argument: can people understand/interpret their own medical data?

--another example: overdiagnosing cancer

-two different questions:
1. Can people accurately *interpret* their own medical data
2. Does it *matter*, given that we're risk averse?

--My stance: it depends
  --give people options whenever possible, but opt systems should be context-specific
  --e.g: HIV tests should be opt-out, but herpes tests should be opt-in. 
  
--Question extends beyond medical data--people have all this data on us, but we often can't access it. Is that ok?
