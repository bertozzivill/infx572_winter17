## Problem Set 1: Intro to R
## Author: Amelia Bertozzi-Villa
## Description: Most instructions require you to write code. When I ask a 
##              direct, question please write a brief response in a comment.
##
##              Comment your code according to the guidelines discussed in 
##              class.

## 1. Basic data types ---------------------------------------------------------

## Divide five by three.

## Have the console print out a greeting.

## Test the truth or falsity of three logical statements.


## 2.Variables  ---------------------------------------------------------

## Create a variable with the value of your favorite number. Create another 
## variable equal to the first variable, squared. Have the console print out 
## whether or not the second variable is equal to ten. 

## 3. 1-Dimensional Arrays  ----------------------------------------------------

## Create a numeric vector five elements long. 
## Lengthen it by three elements. Keep only the six elements in the middle. 

## 4. Logic and Loops  ---------------------------------------------------------

## For each element of the vector created in question 3, create a loop that tests
## if that element is greater than 7.2. If it is, have the console print out your
## favorite movie quote. If it isn't, print the title of your favorite book.

## Expand the code above such that, if a number is less than 7.2 but greater than 2, 
## the console prints out the title and artist of the last song you listened to.
## (Copy and paste your code so I can see both versions.)
