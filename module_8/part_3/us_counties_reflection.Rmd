For obvious reasons, this paper is quite near and dear to my heart, and I know quite a bit about how this analysis was performed. I'm going to go into some detail on the methods to clear up some confusion, then address a few other common theme from the discussion thread. 

## Methods

### Regression Specification
Everyone who responded to the question about predictor and outcome variables for the regression analysis accurately stated that the outcome variable of this analysis was cause-specific mortality rate. But most of you stated that the predictor variable was "county", which is not quite correct. Saying that the predictor variable is "county" is kind of like saying that the predictor variable in our "Salaries" regression is "professor"-- the county isn't a predictor variable, it's our **unit of analysis**. 

In the dataset that we use to run the regression, every row represents a particular county-year-sex-age group. There's a column for county identifier, year, sex, and age that collectively uniquely identify that row as a unit of analysis. There's a column for the mortality rate within that county-year-sex-age group. Then there are columns for all of our *covariates*: the proportion of the adult population who has graduated high school; the proportion of the population that is Hispanic; the proportion of the population that is Black; the proportion of the population that is a race other than Black or white; the proportion of a county that is contained within a state or federal Native American reservation; the median household income; and the population density. **These** are our predictor variables, not county. The results that you see in the maps are what happens when you use this model to predict mortality rates for a new place. 

If we had to write a regression equation for our model, it would look like this:

$$ mortality\_rate = \beta_0 + \beta_1education + \beta_2percent\_Hispanic + \\ \beta_3percent\_Black + \beta_4percent\_white + \beta_5percent\_other +\\ \beta_6percent\_reservation + \beta_7income + \beta_8population\_density + \\ \beta_9year + \beta_10sex + \beta_{11}age + [spatiotemporal\ smoothing] + \varepsilon  $$

A few things to note about this: 

1. Instead of betas 9-11, we actually use something called a *random effect* on time, sex, and age;
2. The "spatial smoothing" part means that we "look next door" and incorporate some information from neighboring counties and neighboring years into the estimate for any given county-year. This allows us to get better estimates for place with small sample sized and few deaths.
