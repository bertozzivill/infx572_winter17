One way to think about regression coefficients is as a series of weights on your
different input variables. As an example, let's say I want to buy a plant. *click*

For any given plant, I can come up with a price that
I'd be willing to pay for it. What I want to do is break down that process-- I
want to answer the question *click* "What factors determine the price I'm willing
to pay for this plant, and how does each factor influence that price?"

*click*

As it turns out, there are lots of factors that go into how much I'd pay for a
plant. These include:
 *click* the size of the plant, which can be further broken
down into *click* height and *click* width;
*click* how rare the plant is;
*click* whether or not the plant looks healthy; and
*click* what type of plant it is.

At the moment, these are all pretty vague categories, so let's quantify them.

*click*

*click* For size, both the *click* width of the plant and the *click* height
of the pot can be measured in inches;
*click* I can measure rarity by how many times I've seen that particular plant
species before;
*click* I can make the plant's health into a binary variable by asking the
question "does this plant look healthy?";
*click* And so far as plant type is concerned, all I really care about is
whether or not the plant is a succulent, so we can make this into a binary
variable as well.

The simplest assumption I could make about these different plant characteristics
is that they *all impact my purchasing price equally*-- so an extra
inch of height would increase the price I'd pay by the same amount that an extra
inch of width would, and the same amount that an additional sighting of that
species would. That is, all of my predictor variables would be *weighted equally*
against each other.

*click* This table gives an example of an equally-weighted set of variables.
Under this schema, I'd be willing to pay $2 more for an extra inch of plant
height, $2 more for an extra inch of pot width, $2 more for every additional time
I'd seen that plant before, $2 more if it looks healthy, and $2 more if it was a
succulent.

Of course, this schema is't actually how anyone makes purchasing decisions. We
care more about some factors than others-- or, put another way, we have unequal
*weights* on our different variables. My personal schema for plant buying, for
example, looks more like this: *click*

As you can see, my primary interest is in whether or not the plant in question is
a succulent-- I'm willing to pay a full $5 more for a succulent plant. The next
biggest contributor is plant rarity-- since I'm more interested in rare plants,
having seen a plant many times before *reduces* how much money I'd be willing
to pay for it. I'm willing to pay a couple bucks extra for a healthy plant, and I'd
pay a little extra for every extra inch of height on a plant. However, I'm low
on window space in my apartment, so a plant in a wider pot actually *reduces*
the amount I'd be willing to pay for it by $1 per inch.

Now, I've just made these numbers up, but coming up with these *weights* is
exactly what a regression does--  model coefficients and weights are
equivalent here. Some of you might find it easier to think of regressions in
terms of the equations written in the lecture, some of you might find it easier
to conceptualize them like this, as a series of weights given to different
input variables. The two interpretations are equivalent.
