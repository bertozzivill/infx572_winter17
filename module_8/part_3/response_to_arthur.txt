Arthur,

The age-standardized results are different from the all-age results because the age-standardized results take the age structure of the population into account. For any given county, year, sex, and cause, we have a mortality rate for each age group-- that is, we have an estimate for how many people died in that age group, as well as the population in that age group.Â 

The "all-ages" mortality rate estimate is what you get when you add all the death counts into one, add all the population counts into one, and divide deaths by population. It just says "how many people died here, per population?"

The problem with this is that, when you want to compare two different rates (from different time periods or counties) to each other, you might be comparing two places with very different age structures. This can mask important trends (in either direction). 

The solution is to age-standardize-- to modify the rates so that they're all in terms of some standard age distribution (like the national age distribution in 2014, which is what we used). This makes mortality rates comparable both over time and over space. 

Statistic Canada has a great explanation of age standardization (here)[http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/dai/btd/asr].
